## 🎓 Study Approach

### For Beginners
1. Start with **Basic/Checking** problems (1-4 in each section)
2. Focus on understanding subsequence vs subarray difference
3. Practice brute force solutions first

### For Intermediate
1. Master **Dynamic Programming** patterns (LCS, LIS)
2. Learn **Sliding Window** technique for subarrays
3. Practice **Two Pointers** approach

### For Advanced
1. Optimize time/space complexity
2. Handle edge cases and constraints
3. Practice **Multi-dimensional** variants

## 🏢 Company-wise Focus

- **Google**: LCS, Maximum subarray, Longest substring
- **Facebook**: Palindromic problems, Array products
- **Amazon**: Two sum variations, Subarray sums
- **Microsoft**: LIS, Bitonic subsequence
- **Apple**: String subsequences, Pattern matching

## 📚 Quick Reference

### Common Patterns
- **Subsequence**: Use DP, recursion with memoization
- **Subarray**: Use sliding window, prefix sums, two pointers
- **Counting**: Mathematical combinations, DP states
- **Optimization**: Greedy when possible, DP otherwise

### Time Complexities
- Basic checking: O(n) to O(n²)
- Counting: O(n) to O(n³)
- LCS/LIS: O(n²) with DP
- Sliding window: O(n)
